<p>We are SeniorAngel, LLC (“SeniorAngel”, “we”, “us” and “our”). Among other things, we are a marketing and communications platform to generate interested consumers for products and services offered by our clients. The Services include a marketing platform for providing interested consumers for insurance carriers, agents, brokers and related entities, (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
<p>Each person or entity who uses our Services is referred to as a “user” or “you” or “your”. If you subscribe to any of our Services, we will refer to you as a “registered user”. If you don’t register with us, we will refer to you as an “unregistered user”. This Privacy Statement and our Terms of Service (“Terms”) apply to each user.</p>
<p>This document is our statement of our privacy practices (“Privacy Statement”). Among other things, it explains how we and some of the companies we work with collect, use, share and protect the information you provide to us (“your Content” or “User Content”). The User Content may include any personally-identifiable information, including without limitation name, address, telephone numbers, electronic mail and postal addresses, personal financial information, and other sensitive information that identifies or is uniquely associated with an individual (collectively, “Personal Data”). This Privacy Statement also discusses your choices about the collection, storage and use of your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Any Content that is not Personal Data is referred to as “Non-Personal Data.” Non-Personal Data includes information about how users use the Services, what Services users select, how users respond to service offerings, how users share information with others, what users say they like and dislike, all of which we aggregate into larger data sets that do not identify individuals (“Behavioral Data”).</p>
<p>Among other services, SeniorAngel connects users with other users, and with companies who provide goods or services which may have value to our users (collectively, “Partners”). This Privacy Statement does not apply to any Partners or to any other websites, mobile applications, or businesses. This Privacy Statement does not apply to any Personal Data or other Content collected via any means other than the Services.</p>
<p>By using our Services, you consent to the collection, transfer, analysis, transformation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your Content, including your Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, we collect Content from you while providing the Services. Some of the Content is Personal Data that we use to contact you and connect you with other users, and which is necessary to provide the Services. Other Content we collect from you, Behavioral Data and other Non-Personal Data that we aggregate, share, and use to improve our Services, and others in the industry. We collect many different types of information from you, both directly and indirectly.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Information you provide us directly</strong></h5>
<p>Registration information. When you create or modify an account, or subscribe to our Services, you provide Personal Data to us, such as your user name, password, postal address and email address.</p>
<p>Payment information. Except for particular cases where we obtain a written credit card authorization (and subject to the terms of the written authorization), we use a third-party payment processor (“Processor”) to process your payments, so we do not store your credit card numbers or other payment information. Please note that our Processor does store and process your credit card numbers and other payment information in accordance with the Processor’s privacy policy and subject to applicable law.</p>
<p>Profile information. You may provide us with additional profile information that you choose to make public or share with other users. You may also provide information to customize your account, such as a telephone number for the delivery of short message system (“SMS”) or text messages. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, events for which you’ve registered, any orders you place, or to market to you. You may use your account settings to customize notifications from us. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.</p>
<p>Location Information. We may ask for your postal address or your geographic location information, especially if you place an order for Services with us. When you post User Content to our website or to social media, you may provide your location information, including global positioning system (“GPS”) data or other location information embedded in or accompanying the User Content (e.g., in tags or captions).</p>
<p>Communications between you and SeniorAngel: We may send you emails, SMS or text messages, and other electronic communications for sales and delivery, account verification, notices of changes/updates to features of the Services, technical and security notices, and for other purposes. We may collect and store these communications.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Information we gather from your use of our Services</strong></h5>
<p>We collect and may save private emails sent to us by users, and we may share your emails with any third parties or other users. Any public posts on the Services may be viewed by any user and are public to anyone who visits the Services. You may elect to disclose certain Personal Data and Non-Personal Data. The information you submit in any public forums is not confidential or private, and SeniorAngel does not protect it. All information you choose to provide publicly, including information that identifies you or others, can be read, collected, or used by other users and by other third parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes.</p>
<p>Social Media. In addition to media that we control, you may post comments, photographs, drawings and other User Content on third party social media, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, each of which enforces its own terms of use and privacy policy for its service. As noted in the Terms and our other online documents, we may use and copy the User Content you post. More to the point, your User Content may contain Personal Data about you and other people in the form of names, email addresses, and location information. You should also be aware that a photograph or drawing of a person may be Personal Data to the extent the person may be recognized in and identified by the photograph or drawing. We may collect and use User Content and the Personal Data contained in the User Content to market our Services.</p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends and other Non-Personal Data for the Services. These tools collect information sent by your device or our Services, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other information that assists us in improving our Services. We collect and combine this analytics information with analytics information from other users so that it cannot be used to identify any particular individual user. One of the analytics tools we use is Google Analytics. For more information and steps you can take to control Google’s collection and use of your data, please visit Google’s page, “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”; <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>. Google also provides an opt-out plugin for web browsers, available here; <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with other data, including User Content. For example, metadata can describe how, when and by whom an item of User Content was collected and how that User Content is formatted. SeniorAngel may collect and store metadata, including about each user’s public posts on the Services.</p>
<p>SeniorAngel may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications and third-party Services by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant local data, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p>Device Identifiers. We may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, or remotely store one or more “device identifiers.” Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your computer, phone or other device, which uniquely identifies your device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by SeniorAngel. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third-party partner about how you browse and use the Services and may help us or others provide reports or personalized Content and ads. Some features of the Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
<p>Log Data. Our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”) created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive log data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our website, sign into our Services or interact with our email notifications. SeniorAngel uses log data to review how we provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve the Services.</p>
<p><strong>2. How We Store Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We currently provide the Services from within the United States, and we store all User Content, including Personal Data, that we currently collect and retain on servers inside the United States.</p>
<p>In the future, we may store Personal Data and other User Content on servers located outside the United States.</p>
<p>Certain types of User Content you submit to us might reveal your gender, ethnic origin, nationality, age, religion, sexual orientation, or other Personal Data about you or others.</p>
<p>By using our Services, or by submitting your personal Information to us, you consent to the collection, storage, processing and onward transfer of your personal Information as stated in the current version of this Privacy Statement and the current version of our other online documents, including the <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We share and use your Personal Data in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>Partners and Affiliates of SeniorAngel. We may share your Personal Data with Partners and with our SeniorAngel affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with SeniorAngel) as necessary to sell and provide the Services. However, any Personal Data stored in one country or jurisdiction would not be forwarded to another country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If you wish to opt out please Email us at <a href="mailto:Hello@seniorangel.com">Hello@seniorangel.com</a></p>
<p>Cookies. Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features and remember your personalization choices. We use cookies to make it easier to access and use our Services. The help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Service’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. Cookies are also used to display particular Content and to set session identifiers for visitors who voluntarily join user areas.</p>
<p>Do Not Track. We make reasonable efforts to honor the “do not track” settings on users’ devices.</p>
<p>Opt-out Email or Postal Address. If you supply us with your postal or email address you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not want to receive such mailings, please let us know by sending an email to us at the “opt-out” address, below. We will remove your name from the list we use internally. Opting-out of these emails does not mean we remove your email from our system entirely, because we still retain your email addresses for other purposes.</p>
<p>Service Providers. We employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g., payment processing, maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development, or to ensure that we are complying with the laws and requirements of various jurisdictions while providing the Services). These third parties may have limited access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated to SeniorAngel not to disclose or use your Personal Data for other purposes.</p>
<p>Required by Law. We may access, preserve and share your Personal Data in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena). We may also access, preserve and share Personal Data when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.</p>
<p>National Security and Intelligence Activities. We may release your Personal Data to authorized federal officials for intelligence, counterintelligence and other national security activities when required by law. For example, under current law in the United States, certain federal officials may require that we provide Personal Data and other Content in response to a national security letter, subpoena, demand, or court order. In some cases, we would be required not to tell you that we complied with that letter, subpoena, demand, or court order. Where permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to comply with, or to fight or quash, any such letter, subpoena, demand, or court order.</p>
<p>Change of Control. If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of SeniorAngel or our assets to another organization (e.g., a merger, acquisition, or reorganization), your Personal Data such as user name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Services may be among the items sold or transferred.</p>
<p>Non-Personal Data. We may share Non-Personal Data publicly and with publishers, researchers or connected sites. For example, we may share aggregated Non-Personal Data publicly to show trends about the general use of our Services. Non-Personal Data includes aggregated or collective information about multiple users that does not reflect or reference an individually-identifiable user.</p>
<p>In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Statement above, we may use Personal Data that we receive to:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>4. Your Right to Review, Request Changes, and Disclose Personal Data</strong><br>
Subject to applicable laws and regulations, each user may inspect and receive a copy of his or her Personal Data as stored in the Services. In rare circumstances, we may deny a request, and we may provide you with an explanation. If we deny your request, you may request a review by another professional, who will be chosen by SeniorAngel, and we will comply with the outcome of the review.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable laws and regulations, the Personal Data you provide to us remains completely under your control. If you believe the Personal Data we have is incorrect or incomplete, you may in writing request an amendment to your Personal Data. We will approve or deny each request, and notify you of our decision. If approved, we will amend the Personal Data. We will also make a reasonable effort to notify people to whom the Personal Data was released. In the case of a denial, we will provide the reason for the denial and instructions on how to appeal.</p>
<p>Any information or User Content that you voluntarily disclose for use of the Services, such as your user name, your Personal Data or your User Content, may become available to the public if you release it to other users or to the general public.

<p><strong>5. Children</strong><br>

<p><strong>6. Changes to this Privacy Statement</strong><br>

If you choose not to be subject to a revised version of this Privacy Statement, then you may terminate your account with us, and the unrevised version of the Privacy Statement will apply.</p>
<p>7. Different Locations, Different Laws<br>
The laws and regulations that address privacy rights and responsibilities (collectively, “Laws”) are different from one to another. Indeed, some of the Laws do or do not apply depending on different factors, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location or residence of the user;</li>
<li>Location or residence of the individual that is the subject of the Personal Data (“Data Subject”);</li>
<li>Location or residence of the person or organization that employs or contracts with the Data Subject;</li>
<li>Location of each server or other machine where the Personal Data is received, stored, processed or forwarded to; or</li>
<li>Location of the relevant office of SeniorAngel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several of the Laws that concern unregistered users, registered users, and SeniorAngel are discussed in this Section, but these are not all of the Laws that may apply. In addition, if there is any conflict or ambiguity between the statements made in this Privacy Statement and an applicable Law, then the Law will control.</p>
<p><strong>a. United States Federal Laws</strong><br>
Several of the federal Laws in the United States may apply to the Personal Data collected by us.</p>
<p>Currently, all Personal Data of users resident in the United States is stored on servers and other machines physically located within the United States.</p>
<p><strong>b. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)</strong><br>
Currently, COPPA does not apply to the Services. Each registered user and other user must be 18 years of age or older. As noted in this Privacy Statement, if we learn of any registered user or user is under the age of 18, or if any parent or guardian contacts us, we will close that person’s account and remove all information provided by the individual from our Services.</p>
<p><strong>c. State Laws in the United States</strong><br>
Individual states in the United States have passed and enforce information privacy and security laws.</p>
<p><strong>d. Your California Privacy Rights</strong><br>

<p><strong>vi. Categories of Information We Collect</strong><br>
