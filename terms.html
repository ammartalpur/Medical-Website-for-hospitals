<p><strong>11. Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SENIORANGEL, ITS PARTNERS, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOOD WILL, OR OTHER LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; AND (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT SENIORANGEL HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<p><strong>12. Exclusions</strong><br>
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>
<p><strong>13. Waiver and Severability</strong><br>
The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

<p><strong>14. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong><br>
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the law of the State of Florida, and the federal law of the United States, without regard to or application of any conflict of laws principles or rules.

This indemnity obligation shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms or your use of the Services.</p>
<p>Any controversy or claim between the parties or arising out of these Terms or any Services shall be determined by one arbitrator in binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules. We anticipate that you may be geographically distant from our offices.
